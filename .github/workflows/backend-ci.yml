    steps:
      # 1) Get your code into the GitHub runner
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2) Install Node (use 20.x LTS – stable and widely used)
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20.x"
          cache: "npm"

      # 3) Install dependencies in clean CI mode
      #    - This is like: rm -rf node_modules && npm install, but safer + faster
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # 4) Run unit tests (Jest)
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      # 5) Check that the TypeScript build works
      #    (This runs your "build" script from package.json)
      - name: Build TypeScript
        run: npm run build
